**Key Features**

* **Port Scanning**: Identify open ports on a target system 📊
* **SQL Injection Scanning**: Detect SQL injection vulnerabilities using sqlmap 💻
* **XSS Scanning**: Identify cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities using xsser 🕷️
* **CSRF Scanning**: Detect cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities 🔒
* **Comprehensive Reporting**: Get a detailed report of identified vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation 📝

**Getting Started**

1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 📦
2. **Run the scanner**: `python main.py` 💻
3. **Enter target IP or domain**: Enter the target IP or domain and the number of ports to scan 📊
